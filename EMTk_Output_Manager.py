    Uses the output files of EMTk to update your database entries with the emotion analysis results accordingly.
    The results will be stored for each entry in a field named 'emotion' which contains a dictionary where each emotion
    has its own entry with <emotion>: YES/NO.

    Requirements:
    The database needs to be running on a local MongoDB client.
    The id of the EMTk results need to correspond to the ids of your database entries (a field named "_id"). For easily
    achieving this use the Input Manager to generate your input.
    The program needs to be executed where the results of the EMTk analysis are stored. This is most likely the shared
    folder of EMTk.
